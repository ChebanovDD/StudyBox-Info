## About

<details><summary>Background Information</summary>
<br />

I've been developing immersive training apps for over five years. Based on this experience I've decided to develop a StudyBox, an XR platform that enables anyone to create immersive training. Doesn't matter whether you know how to program or not with StudyBox you can create your own virtual training program quickly and easily.
